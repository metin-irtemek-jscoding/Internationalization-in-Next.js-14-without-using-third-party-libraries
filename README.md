# Internationalization-in-Next.js-without-using-third-party-libraries
I would like to tell you about the structure I use in my own projects. You do not need to install any third party libraries in this structure. There is no complex code structure. You can add as many languages as you want. You can run these languages on both the server side and the client side without any problems.
